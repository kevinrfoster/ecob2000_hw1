*This first HW has complicated multiple due dates for different parts, see details below.  In general HW are due after each class, where I usually give you night-owls the option of working until 8am the next morning.*

*Each student should submit a separate assignment, even if it is an identical computer file to the rest of your study group. I'll put a HW1 channel on Slack and you should, ideally, put a link to your github there. When submitting assignments, please include your name and the assignment number as part of the filename. Please write the names of your study group members at the beginning of your homework.*


1. What are the names of the people in your study group (for now)?
2. Work on the Hawkes stats review - you must complete the diagnostic test by end of the day Friday Sept 27.
3.	*this is due before class* During class on Thursday, we'll do experiments on sequences of random numbers. I gave out dice in first class, for you to play with -- sanding, filing, heating, drilling, gluing, squeezing or whatever -- to see if you can adjust which numbers come up. Before class, you should have done about 20 experiments where you roll the dice and record whether the result was a 6 or not. 
4.	Open up R (on laptop or cloud). Replicate the commands given in the lecture notes *R Basics for Lecture 1* to do some simple stats on the Household Pulse data.  Those notes request that you find average ages for men and women. Tell me something else interesting, that you learned from the data. Are there surprises for you? We will use this same data for a few exercises so it's worth getting deeper into it.
5.  Think about some interesting questions to ask about that Household Pulse Data. We'll talk about those in class.
6.  Look over Lab 1, to start thinking about what you're being asked to do. We'll discuss more in class.


*The dice example is from Andrew Gelman's book on Teaching Stats.*
